# week3-API-Project
<!-- add image here -->
What?
I this project we used to API's: Wikipedia and Game of Thrones, which give us info 
about a character given by the user. ex. Name, House, picture and a description.

Why?
The goal of this project is to make a web site to easily and quickly get useful info about any GOT character

How?
Simple start typing a name and the search bar will autocomplete the name for you. 
Then hit the search button.

Challenges:
One of the challenges was to make the autocomplete list appear in the right place; 
right below the search bar. In order to solve this issue I had to do some googling and asking; until I found a solution where I needed to move around some code; specifically, I had to move the fetch method out of the onClick event.
<!-- Any more challenges? -->

Features:
Autocomplete: start typing and options will appear. Then left click the desired option.
Case-sensitivity: All name searches are case-insensitive.
 <!-- Any more cool features?  -->

Technologies: Javascript,HTML,CSS
